# Temperatus

A Mac application which shows the current temperature using a Thermodo device.

Read more about the Thermodo device at [thermodo.com](http://thermodo.com)

## Use at your own risk. Seriously.

The ThermodoSDK currently used in the application is an early version and I had to workaround some quirks. This means that your computer might blow up or [do the Harlem Shake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hpEnLtqUDg). But it probably won't.

## Installation

The easiest way to install Temperatus is to [grab the latest version from the releases](https://github.com/simonbs/Temperatus/releases) and install it like any other application.

If, however, you like to do it the difficult way, you are welcome to clone the repository and build the app yourself.

## Wait, I can't hear Miley Cyrus?

That's right. Just like your iPhone or Android phone, your Mac won't blast Miley Cyrus when a Thermodo is plugged in. If [you want to twerk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUvu1mlWco#t=1m26s), you will have to unplug your Thermodo.

## Why does it melt my brain when I plug in my earpods?

That's because the Thermodo SDK plays a funny noise to do its voodoo. Deal with it.

## I think it behaves a little odd...

It probably does behave a little odd now and then. I haven't found any issues but there could be. As mentioned earlier, it uses an early version of the Thermodo SDK. That might cause issues.

Maybe there are bugs in the app. I don't know of any but please open an issue or even better: send a pull request, if you find a bug.

## Boring stuff

The app is developed by [@simonbs](http://twitter.com/simonbs/). Thanks to [@robocat](http://twitter.com/robocat/) for letting me publish the app and lending me the image used in the icon and in the status bar.
